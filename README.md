# Imagene Web

Imagene Web is a rebuild of the existing Imagene C++ application.
The application is an implementation of a genetic programming.

Users create initial populations of math expressions.
From this population, image samples are generated by randomly selecting three individuals of the population to become the inputs for the R, G and B components of each pixel coordinate.

Upon generating samples, users may rank the fitness of each sample. The ranking/fitness assigned is averaged and applied to the underlying individuals for the R, G and B Components.

Once a user is happy with the fitness levels of the current generation/population individuals, they may choose to "evolve" the population into a new generation.

Evolving a population creates a new generation by applying elitism, mutation and crossover to the previous individuals. 

## Todo/Works in progress

* Huntdown any instances of state mutation (there are several) these are likely causing odd side effects.
* Implement operand/operator selection and probailities for generation of initial population and selection of new expressions when mutating individuals

* Cross Browser bug fixes
* Web Worker Thread Pool
* Sample Controls
  * Multi-select control panel
  * Single select control panel
  * Export sample image at various settings

* Mutation
* Crossover
* Population Graph (Output as binary tree visualization, maybe use D3.js)
* Feature locks, e.g Prevent editing of previous generation, samples etc.. if subsequent generations have been created
* Implement rollback ability - e.g revert to previous generation
* UI Cleanup/Improvements
* Export
* Import
